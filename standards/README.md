# Introduction
The RMRK standard evolves from the RMRK2.0 standard; however, the implementation of the standard has grown.  As such, there are some limitations and capacities that exist depending upon the implementation.

As such, this guide is split into four parts

- [rmrk0.1](./rmrk0.1/README.md): RMRK0.1 standard
- [rmrk1.0.0](./rmrk1.0.0/README.md): RMRK1 standard
- [rmrk2.0.0](./rmrk2.0.0/README.md): RMRK2 standard


- [Abstract](./abstract): Generalized specification of the RMRK standard as it must apply to any implementation
- [Kusama](./kusama): Kusama (extrinsic) implementation of the RMRK standard, including caveats and examples
- [Substrate](./substrate): Substrate (pallet) implementation of the RMRK standard, including caveats and examples
- [EVM](./evm): EVM implementation of the RMRK standard, including caveats and examples

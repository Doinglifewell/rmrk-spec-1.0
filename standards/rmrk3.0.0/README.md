# Introduction
The RMRK3.0 standard evolves from the RMRK2.0 standard; however, the implementation of the standard has grown.  As such, there are some limitations and capacities that exist depending upon the implementation.

As such, this guide is split into four parts

- [Abstract](./abstract/README.md): Generalized specification of the RMRK3.0 standard as it must apply to any implementation
- [Kusama](./kusama/README.md): Kusama (extrinsic) implementation of the RMRK3.0 standard, including caveats and examples
- [Substrate](./substrate/README.md): Substrate (pallet) implementation of the RMRK3.0 standard, including caveats and examples
- [EVM](./evm/README.md): EVM implementation of the RMRK3.0 standard, including caveats and examples
